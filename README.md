# Amora Battle System

This repo contains the battle system implementatdion of the story based game we designed and documented, only implmenting the battle system to provide a balancing and testbed for the win rate and statistics of gameplay, which was the aim of this co-teached subject.


# Instructions

When you open the game (we recommend you use the Unity Project since it allows you to tweak some values like player & enemy lvl or even values inside the scripts themselves if you're proficient enough), you will wee 3 buttons and a small input text box.

* **Player vs AI:** Clicking this button allows you to play against a bot that chooses actions randomly.


* **AI vs AI:** You spectate 2 bots playing against each other choosing actions randomly.


* **Battle Simulator:** You will spectate the ammount of combats inputted in the input text box under this button. The battles are at super speed mode so you can basically go grab a glass of water or make some coffee while the simulation is calculated depending on the ammount of combats you want to simulate.
